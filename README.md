# RFLP Toolkit: Enhancing SNP Detection with Precision

## Overview

The RFLP Toolkit emerges at the crossroads of molecular biology and bioinformatics, addressing a critical challenge in Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) detection. In the realm of DNA analysis, the power of Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) is undeniable. However, certain SNPs face a hurdleâ€”lack of suitable enzymes for effective detection.

To bridge this gap, a dedicated bioinformatician crafted the RFLP Toolkit. This innovative tool goes beyond conventional approaches, not only identifying enzymes suitable for RFLP detection but also proposing strategic nucleotide modifications near restriction sites. These modifications, achieved through primer mismatching, aim to transform previously unusable enzymes into powerful tools for SNP detection.

The RFLP Toolkit introduces a new paradigm in precision SNP detection, offering a versatile and strategic approach to overcome limitations in enzyme availability. As we embark on this scientific journey, the RFLP Toolkit invites researchers and bioinformaticians to contribute, collaborate, and shape the future of SNP detection methodologies.


## Features

- **Enzyme Suitability Analysis:** Determine if existing enzymes can be utilized for RFLP detection of a specific SNP.
- **Strategic Primer Mismatching:** Propose sequence modifications to enhance enzyme efficacy for previously challenging SNPs.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generate detailed reports on enzyme suitability, proposed modifications, and SNP-specific insights.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (>=3.6)
- Biopython library

### Installation

Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/RFLP-Toolkit.git
    ```

### Usage

Run the tool with the following command:

```bash
python run_res_enzyme.py <submission_file> <result_file> [--email <your_email>]
```

``` bash
python run_res_enzyme.py submissions.txt report.txt --email user@example.com
```
This addition informs users that an example `submissions.txt` file is included in the repository. Users can refer to this file as a template for creating their own submissions. The file showcases one of the accepted formats for defining a SNP to the tool.
